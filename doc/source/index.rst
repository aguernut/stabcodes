Stabcodes' documentation
========================

**Stabcodes** is a Python library that comes as a wrapper around **stim** and offers high-level functions and classes to simulate Quantum Error Correction circuit experiments.

.. note::

   This library was developed during my thesis to simplify my stim experiment. It is *not* in active development. Check out the :doc:`usage` section to :ref:`install <installation>` it.
